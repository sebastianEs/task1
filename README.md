# React js form

This app was built with react js and tested with Enzyme.

# Task description

Create a new web application. The app component must contain a form where the user can fill in the name and email address. The form should be in a separate component. When writing in any of the form elements, the text must be saved in the App component state. Write tests for the component before implementing it. Then create a button that is in a separate component. When you click on it, the name and email address must be cleared from the App component state. There must be test cases that test that the form contains input elements and that the button component contains an element with the CSS class "buttonClass". Use the Enzyme API. The web application should be in a git repository, which you upload to GitHub. You should make at least one commit case test before making a commit with the corresponding implementation. (Commit test cases before you commit the implementation.) That is because I can see that you have used the TDD method "red, green, refactor".
